  Warnings:

  - The `discount` column on the `Product` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `price` on the `Product` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
